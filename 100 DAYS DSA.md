**Data Structures**
1. Arrays: A collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.
2. Linked Lists: A linear collection of elements, where each element points to the next.
3. Stacks: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, where elements are added and removed from the same end.
4. Queues: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure, where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
5. Trees: Hierarchical data structures with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node.
6. Binary Trees: A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children.
7. Binary Search Trees (BST): A binary tree where the left child of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right child contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.
8. Heaps: A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.
9. Hash Tables: A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.
10. Graphs: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes.
11. Tries: A tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings.
12. Priority Queues: An abstract data type similar to regular queues or stacks but each element has an associated priority.
13. Hash Maps: A type of data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup.
