respected amit sir,  
Today is 1st of nov and it marks 6 months of me interning in this company.  
After 6 months of experience with this company i am here to discuss my future at aventure solution.  
  
These 6 months have been great in terms of working on a real project , learning the industry standard technologies and then implementing them.  
But now i want to dive deeper and get more responsibility of projects and handle real world problems. That is why i am formally asking for a permanent position at Aventure Solution.  
  
I would love to meet the team, join the team and learn from their experience of this industry.  
It is only my future as a software developer that seek and i am hoping that this company can help me get there.  
Thanx  
Raghav
