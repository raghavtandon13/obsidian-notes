Comparison between the two sets of documentation to highlight the differences:

**First Set of Documentation (Original Documentation):**

- Token Generation API URL: `https://deployapigateway.moneywide.com/token`
- LOS Push API URL: `https://deployapigateway.moneywide.com/api/connectorapi-updated-flow`
- Static token for testing: `69477957-00a6-4b4b-acb2-5f6d303d02d1`

**Second Set of Documentation (Updated Documentation):**

- Token Generation API URL: `https://pydeploy.moneywide.in/token`
- LOS Push API URL: `https://deployapigateway.moneywide.com/api/pa-pushlos`
- Static token for testing: `6bf4b0fe-d412-4b42-8d2e-625c2ec20bc5`

**Key Differences:**

1. **Token Generation API URL:**
    - In the first documentation, the Token Generation API URL is `https://deployapigateway.moneywide.com/token`.
    - In the second documentation, the Token Generation API URL is `https://pydeploy.moneywide.in/token`.
2. **LOS Push API URL:**
    - In the first documentation, the LOS Push API URL is `https://deployapigateway.moneywide.com/api/connectorapi-updated-flow`.
    - In the second documentation, the LOS Push API URL is `https://deployapigateway.moneywide.com/api/pa-pushlos`.
3. **Static Token for Testing:**
    - In the first documentation, the static token for testing is `69477957-00a6-4b4b-acb2-5f6d303d02d1`.
    - In the second documentation, the static token for testing is `6bf4b0fe-d412-4b42-8d2e-625c2ec20bc5`.
4. **Additional Input Fields:**
    - The second set of documentation includes additional input fields such as `customer_first_name`, `customer_last_name`, `employment_type`, and `reference_id`. These fields are not present in the first set of documentation.
5. **Response Messages:**
    - Both sets of documentation have similar response messages for success, failure, and validation error. The response structure and status codes are consistent.
6. **Token Validity:**
    - The second documentation specifies that the token received from the Token Generation API is valid for 24 hours. The first documentation does not mention token validity.

These are the key differences between the two sets of documentation. The second documentation includes some additional input fields and specifies the token's validity duration. Please let me know if you need further clarification or if you have any specific questions related to these differences.
